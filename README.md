# FinalCS255
I tackled the DriverPass project for DriverPass, who wanted a cloud-hosted online training platform to help students breeze through their DMV driving exams. They needed a unified system to manage user accounts, deliver interactive lessons and practice tests, schedule behind-the-wheel training, and integrate live DMV policy updates. I feel I really nailed capturing their business needs in the functional and nonfunctional requirements—defining precise user roles and permissions, mapping out reservation flows, and laying out performance and security constraints—and visualizing the solution with UML use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams. If there’s one thing I’d tweak, it would be the UI section: I’d dive deeper into wireframes or clickable prototypes tied to concrete user personas so we can validate the flow and layout before committing to code.

From the interview transcript, I zeroed in on the core pain points—high test-failure rates and scheduling headaches—and turned those into features like progress tracking, automated notifications for DMV updates, and a flexible lesson-booking engine. By grounding every design decision in real user stories, I made sure the platform isn’t just technically robust, but truly solves customers’ problems—because real user buy-in is crucial for adoption and long-term success. My design process starts with stakeholder conversations and a bullet-driven Business Requirements Document, then transitions into UML modeling and a detailed System Design Document with clear hardware, software, and infrastructure specs. Going forward, I’ll layer in user-centric techniques like story mapping, rapid prototyping, and Domain-Driven Design—bringing stakeholders into each sprint to validate assumptions and keep our roadmap laser-focused on solving their most pressing needs.
