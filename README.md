I worked on the DriverPass project, which aimed to develop a cloud-hosted online training platform to help students pass their DMV driving exams more easily. They needed a unified system to manage user accounts, deliver interactive lessons and practice tests, schedule behind-the-wheel training, and integrate live DMV policy updates. I successfully captured their business needs by defining precise user roles and permissions, mapping out reservation flows, and outlining performance and security constraints. I also visualized the solution using UML use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams. If there’s one thing I’d tweak, it'd be the UI section: I’d dive deeper into wireframes or clickable prototypes tied to concrete user personas, so we can validate the flow and layout before committing to code.

From the interview transcript, I identified the core pain points — high test-failure rates and scheduling headaches — and turned those into features, including progress tracking, automated notifications for DMV updates, and a flexible lesson-booking engine. By grounding every design decision in real user stories, I ensure the platform isn’t just technically robust, but also truly solves customers’ problems, because real user buy-in is crucial for adoption and long-term success. My design process begins with stakeholder conversations and a bullet-driven Business Requirements Document, then transitions into UML modeling and a detailed System Design Document that includes precise specifications for hardware, software, and infrastructure. Going forward, I’ll layer in techniques such as story mapping, rapid prototyping, and involving stakeholders in each sprint to validate assumptions and keep our roadmap laser-focused on solving their most pressing needs.
